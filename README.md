# Conversational Azure OpenAI (ChatGPT) Accelerator

**Rapid, no-cost Custom Demo tailored to customer use cases, from internal HR/IT to external contact center to training, teaching and learning for public, consumers, constituents, students, faculty or staff. Focused on top use cases of GenAI conversation and summarization, plus live backend data integration.**

Here are two examples of customers — using this GenAI Accelerator and only in-house resources to deploy valuable automated conversations:

Demos of three different campuses and customer teams showing off their Azure-via-Zammo automated conversation projects, including:
- IT Help Desk
- Accessibility Technology Initiative (ATI)
- Student Grade Checker with backend integration to Canvas Learning Management System (LMS)—API integration completed in three weeks using only in house resources

Automating conversations across voice and text channels is a valuable, even essential, way to save money and improve customer and employee experience. Yet the slow, complex and expensive traditional process has blocked progress. Today, however, the era of manually curating knowledge bases is officially over.

With most customers requesting "ChatGPT using only my data," the best approach to do that efficiently and powerfully is by combining Azure OpenAI + Cognitive Search. This Accelerator quickly provides a ChatGPT experience using your web pages, knowledge base articles and data sources. It also deploys these automated conversations across voice, text and social channels, in multiple languages, with unified analytics.

The Conversational Azure OpenA Accelerator natively uses Microsoft’s most advanced AI including Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Search in the software tooling of trusted partner Zammo.ai, which combines ~50 Azure resources in a unique voice-first architecture, residing securely on your Azure tenant.

The Accelerator enables simultaneous deployment of conversational content to chatbots, IVR, voice assistants and more in one click. This accelerator solution has virtually eliminated the need for in-depth IT involvement by providing a feature-rich platform that any user can navigate, regardless of their technical background. It provides customers with 24/7 automated assistance, leveraging OpenAI’s powerful ChatGPT language engine, combined with the Azure Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) and LUIS natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. This results in a conversational experience that can converse in human-like dialogue, respond intelligently, and capture content, all captured in omni-channel unified analytics which provides valuable insights to improve customer experience.

* Develop multi-turn conversational experiences and connect to backend systems and/or other Azure services like Cognitive Search, Document Translation, Custom Voice, AI Personalizer, Recommendation Engine, Speaker Verification, etc. 
* Rapidly augment existing IVR system by adding a conversational AI layer vs. Long, expensive rip and replace projects  
* Provide improved user-experience with 24/7 support and address routine and repetitive inquires much faster 
* Avoid lengthy and complex IT projects with a solution live in days or weeks not months or years
