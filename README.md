# Conversational AI Accelerator

## About this accelerator
 Contact centers are facing growing pressure to adapt digital experiences for delivery of enhanced multi-modal content. They must also minimize additional costs and improve operational efficiency. Local government agencies are facing near-constant change in their information environments. This can be especially challenging when existing sytems are already overwhelmed, provide limited solutions for ADA and multilingual needs, and require workers to spend valuable time manually routing calls and answering simple frequently asked questions.

 The Conversational AI Accelerator enables quick implementation of conversational AI into communication channels like chatbots, consumer voice assistants, and as an augmentation layer within existing IVR system. It provides customers with 24/7 bot assistance that can converse in human-like dialogue, respond intelligently, and capture content, all while providing valuable insights for content optimization and strategic decision-making.
 
 
 ## Challenges
 * Mutlilingual and accessible communications are costly and critical for quality service
 * Call routing can be complex and slow, requiring multiple handoffs and long wait times
 * High cost of hiring, training and retaining agents
 * Employee satisfaction and time are lost to manual call routing and responding to simple and repititive questions
 * Insights from communications are not being captured to drive optimization
 * Nonrelevant responses from traditional IVR and chatbot systems
 * Meeting customer expectations for 24/7 service can be cost rehibitive to support
 
 ## Benefits
 * Automate multilingual intelligent responses
 * Provide a digital communication experience that is accessible and ADA compliant
 * Manage fluctuations and increases in volume without hiring more agents
 * Implement efficient and effective call routing strategies
 * Boost workforce productivity by addressing routine inquiries
 * Handle the bulk of call volume, leaving agents for more nuanced conversations
 * Provide improved customer access with 24/7 support and addres routine and repetivie inquires six-times faster
